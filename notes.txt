tiger beetle often uses unsigned 128 bit integers for both ids and amounts
This is not possible for both use cases for the following reasons.

- cannot be used for amounts since sqlite converts very large integers into floats.
because of the lack of precision of floats this is not ideal for monetary operations.

- for the id, ULIDs are highly recommended, but a ULID converted into an int requires unsigned 128 bit integer.
- again, sqllite will convert this very large numbers into floats.


solution
- for amounts use integer type, the constraint will be largest signed 64 bit int.
- for ids, use a blob or text.


- Using STRICT on the table will ensure that integer fields are never stored as Floats if they get too large.
